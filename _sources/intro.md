# About
[CVE.ICU](https://cve.icu) is a passion project by [Jerry Gamblin](https://www.jerrygamblin.com). The goal is to dive deep into Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) by pulling and analyzing all the CVE data from the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

## Goals
The main aim of CVE.ICU is to make sense of all this data and present it in a way that's easy to understand through cool graphs and charts. 
 
This automated analysis helps:
- Spot patterns and trends in cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- Give researchers and cybersecurity pros a better handle on what's going on and what's coming next.

## Open Source and Collaboration
The [source code](https://github.com/jgamblin/cve.icu) for this project is up on GitHub. It's open for everyone to see, use, and improve. By keeping it open-source, I'm hoping to get contributions and ideas from the community to make it even better.

## Timely Updates
To keep things fresh, the data on CVE.ICU is updated every 4 hours using GitHub Actions. This way, you always get the latest insights into the ever-changing world of cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

## Get Involved
I love hearing from people who are interested in this project. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@jgamblin](https://twitter.com/jgamblin) if you have any questions or just want to chat about CVE.ICU.
